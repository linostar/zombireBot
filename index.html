<a id="how-to-play" class="anchor" href="#how-to-play" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to Play</h2>

<p>Vampires and zombies are trying to annihilate and destroy each other. Every player joining the game will be either a vampire or a zombie at random. Vampires can attack zombies only, and vice versa. Furthermore, vampires can heal vampires only, and zombies can heal zombies only.</p>

<p>Each player has the following stats:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>HP :</strong>  those are the health points (they have no maximum limit per player)</li>
<li>
<strong>MP :</strong>  those represent how many remaining actions the player can do in the current hour</li>
<li>
<strong>Maximum MP :</strong>  those are the maximum actions per hour for the player</li>
<li>
<strong>Score :</strong>  each successful attack will gives the player 1 point in score</li>
<li>
<strong>Bonus :</strong>  if present, it will give a positive or negative boost to the player attack/defense</li>
</ul>

<p>Each player upon registration will have an HP of 10, and an MP and Maximum MP of 5.</p>

<p>Each player can take two types of <strong>actions</strong> against other players. Both actions will consume 1 MP from the player stats:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>!attack :</strong>  Both players (attacker and target) will throw a dice each. The difference in dice numbers will be subtracted from the loser's HP and added to the winner's HP. In case of a tie, nothing happens. <strong>If a player's HP reaches 0, he/she will transform automatically to the opposite type (vampire -&gt; zombie or zombie -&gt; vampire)</strong>. Players cannot attack players of the same type.</li>
<li>
<strong>!heal :</strong>  The player will sacrifice 2 HP to give an ally 1 HP. The player needs at least 3 HP to make this action. Players cannot heal players of the opposite type.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Each one hour</strong>, the MP of all players will be regenerated and filled up to their respective Maximum MP.</p>

<p><strong>About Maximum MP</strong>, if a player makes 5 successful attacks in a row (with no ties in between), his/her Maximum MP will go up by 1 point. However, if he/she makes 5 failed attacks in row, his/her Maximum MP will go down by 1 point.</p>

<p><strong>Concerning bonus</strong>, every 3 hours, some players may find random items or get affected by random objects, leading to a temporary positive or negative effect on their attack/defense. The bonus effect will last for 1 hour only.</p>

<p><strong>The game will end</strong> when all players become vampires, or all players become zombies. The highscorer player will have his/her name added to the highscore table, and the round will end removing all players from the game. To participate in a new round, the players will have to type the <code>!register</code> command again.</p>
