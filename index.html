<a id="how-to-play" class="anchor" href="#how-to-play" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to Play</h2>

<p>Vampires and zombies are trying to annihilate and destroy each other. Every player joining the game will be either a vampire or a zombie at random. Vampires can attack zombies only, and vice versa. Furthermore, vampires can heal vampires only, and zombies can heal zombies only.</p>

<p>Each player has the following stats:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>HP :</strong>  those are the health points (they have no maximum limit per player)</li>
<li>
<strong>MP :</strong>  those represent how many remaining actions the player can do in the current hour</li>
<li>
<strong>Maximum MP :</strong>  those are the maximum actions per hour for the player</li>
<li>
<strong>Score :</strong>  score points awarded for healings and successful attacks</li>
<li>
<strong>Bonus :</strong>  if present, it will give a positive or negative boost to the player attack/defense</li>
</ul>

<p>Each player upon registration will have an HP of 10, and an MP and Maximum MP of 5.</p>

<p>Each player can take 3 types of <strong>actions</strong> against other players:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>!attack :</strong>  Both players (attacker and target) will throw a dice each. The difference in dice numbers will be subtracted from the loser's HP and added to the winner's HP. In case of a tie, nothing happens. <strong>If a player's HP reaches 0, he/she will transform automatically to the opposite type (vampire -&gt; zombie or zombie -&gt; vampire)</strong>. Players cannot attack players of the same type. This action consumes 1 MP from the attacking player.</li>
<li>
<strong>!heal :</strong>  The player will sacrifice 2 HP to give an ally 1 HP. The player needs at least 3 HP to make this action. Players cannot heal players of the opposite type. This action consumes 1 MP from the healing player.</li>
<li>
<strong>!ambush :</strong>  Player will attack 2 enemies simultaneously. If the ambush succeeds, he/she will gain 6 HP and the other two will loose 3 HP each. If not, he/she will loose 6 HP and the other two gain 3 HP each. The player needs at least 6 HP to make this action, and it will consume 2 MP from his/her stats.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Each one hour</strong>, the MP of all players will be regenerated and filled up to their respective Maximum MP.</p>

<p><strong>About Maximum MP</strong>, if a player makes 5 successful attacks/ambushes in a row (with no ties in between), his/her Maximum MP will go up by 1 point. However, if he/she makes 5 failed attacks/ambushes in row, his/her Maximum MP will go down by 1 point.</p>

<p><strong>Concerning bonus</strong>, every 3 hours, some players may find random items or get affected by random objects, leading to a temporary positive or negative effect on their attack/defense. The bonus effect will last for 1 hour only.</p>

<p><strong>Scoring:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>a healing gives 1 score point</li>
<li>a successful attack gives 2 score points</li>
<li>a successful ambush gives 3 score points</li>
<li>attacking and killing an enemy gives 5 additional score points</li>
<li>successfully attacking and inflicting damage on the enemy leader gives 10 score points (instead of 2)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Player settings:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>!auto register</code> command, when set to <code>on</code>, allows the player to automatically register when a new round of the game begins.</li>
<li>
<code>!auto heal</code> command, if set to <code>lowest</code>, will make the player automatically heals the ally with the lowest HP, before the current hour ends. If set to <code>highest</code>, the target of healing will be the ally with the highest HP. The player should at least 1 MP remaining for that auto-action to take place.</li>
<li>
<code>!auto attack</code> command, similarly to <code>!auto heal</code>, allows the player to attack the enemy with the lowest or highest HP, before the current hour ends.</li>
<li>
<code>!auto search</code> command, will allow the player to auto-spend 1 MP (if available) to search for an item. It won't work of the user inventory is already full.</li>
<li>Note that enabling <code>!auto attack</code> will cancel <code>!auto heal</code> and <code>!auto search</code>, and vice versa.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Items:</strong></p>

<p>Players can search for items and use them. Searching for items using the <code>!search</code> command will consume 1 MP. The chance of finding an item is 25%. Be aware that the player inventory has a limited capacity of 3 items.</p>

<p>Here is a full list of the items that can be found:</p>

<table>

</table>

<p>The unused items will remain in the player inventory even after a round ends.</p>

<p><strong>Special apperarences:</strong></p>

<p>The respective leaders of vampires and zombies, Count Dracula and General Zombilo, will join the battle once a day at random time, for 15 minutes each. When they are around, their soldiers will have a dramatical boost in attack and defense, temporarily removing any other negative effects. When the leader leaves, his soldiers bonus stats return as they were before his arrival. </p>

<p>Those leaders can be attacked when they appear using the <code>!challenge</code> command. Be aware that they use a 12-face dice though, when the player uses a 6-face dice. A successful attack will award the player 10 score points.</p>

<p><strong>End of Round:</strong></p>

<p>The game will end when all players become vampires, or all players become zombies. The highscorer player will have his/her name added to the highscore table, and the round will end removing all players from the game. To participate in a new round, the players will have to type the <code>!register</code> command again.</p>
