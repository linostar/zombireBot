Every player joining the game will be either a vampire or a zombie at random. Vampires can attack zombies only, and vice versa. Furthermore, vampires can heal vampires only, and zombies can heal zombies only.\r\n\r\nEach player has the following stats:\r\n- **HP :**  those are the health points (they have no maximum limit per player)\r\n- **MP :**  those represent how many remaining actions the player can do in the current hour\r\n- **Maximum MP :**  those are the maximum actions per hour for the player\r\n- **Score :**  score points awarded for healings and successful attacks\r\n- **Bonus :**  if present, it will give a positive or negative boost to the player attack/defense\r\n\r\nEach player upon registration will have an HP of 10, and an MP and Maximum MP of 5.\r\n\r\nEach player can take 3 types of **actions** against other players:\r\n- **!attack :**  Both players (attacker and target) will throw a dice each. The difference in dice numbers will be subtracted from the loser's HP and added to the winner's HP. In case of a tie, nothing happens. **If a player's HP reaches 0, he/she will transform automatically to the opposite type (vampire -> zombie or zombie -> vampire)**. Players cannot attack players of the same type. This action consumes 1 MP from the attacking player.\r\n- **!heal :**  The player will sacrifice 2 HP to give an ally 1 HP. The player needs at least 3 HP to make this action. Players cannot heal players of the opposite type. This action consumes 1 MP from the healing player.\r\n- **!ambush :**  Player will attack 2 enemies simultaneously. If the ambush succeeds, he/she will gain 6 HP and the other two will loose 3 HP each. If not, he/she will loose 6 HP and the other two gain 3 HP each. The player needs at least 6 HP to make this action, and it will consume 2 MP from his/her stats.\r\n\r\n**Each one hour**, the MP of all players will be regenerated and filled up to their respective Maximum MP.\r\n\r\n**About Maximum MP**, if a player makes 5 successful attacks/ambushes in a row (with no ties in between), his/her Maximum MP will go up by 1 point. However, if he/she makes 5 failed attacks/ambushes in row, his/her Maximum MP will go down by 1 point.\r\n\r\n**Concerning bonus**, every 3 hours, some players may find random items or get affected by random objects, leading to a temporary positive or negative effect on their attack/defense. The bonus effect will last for 1 hour only.\r\n\r\n**Scoring:**\r\n- a healing gives 1 score point\r\n- a successful attack gives 2 score points\r\n- a successful ambush gives 3 score points\r\n\r\n**End of Round:**\r\n\r\nThe game will end when all players become vampires, or all players become zombies. The highscorer player will have his/her name added to the highscore table, and the round will end removing all players from the game. To participate in a new round, the players will have to type the `!register` command again.\r\n\r\n### List of user commands\r\n- **!howtoplay :**  displays a link to this page\r\n- **!register :**  transforms te player into a vampire or a zombie and let him/her participate in the game\r\n- **!unregister :**  removes the player from the game\r\n- **!attack _player_ :**  lets the player attack a player of the opposite type (an enemy)\r\n- **!heal _player_ :**  lets the player heal a player of the same type (an ally)\r\n- **!ambush _player1_ _player2_ :**  lets the player attack 2 enemy players simultaneously\r\n- **!status _player_ :**  displays the stats of the mentioned player\r\n- **!vampires :**  lists all vampires in the current round\r\n- **!zombies :**  lists all zombies in the current round\r\n- **!topscores** or **!highscores :**  displays the top 10 highscores in the game\r\n\r\n### List of admin commands\r\nAll admin commands are in the following syntax:\r\n```\r\n/msg <botname> admin <admin_passwd> <command> ...\r\n```\r\nwhere `<botname>` is the registered nick used by the bot, and `<admin_passwd>` is the one configured in `config.yml` file.\r\n\r\nThe possible commands are:\r\n\r\n- **quit _message_ :**  makes the bot disconnect (*message* is optional and will appear in the bot quitting message)\r\n- **kick _player(s)_ :**  removes player(s) from the game (you can specify a list of players separated by spaces)\r\n- **stats :**  displays the total of vampires and zombies in the current round\r\n- **topscores** or **highscores :**  displays the top 10 highscores with more details\r\n- **clearscores :**  deletes all entries from the highscore table\r\n","google":"UA-65894507-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
